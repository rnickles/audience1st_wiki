# Overview

A season has a start date (opening night of the season, usually).  Any references to "the season" use that boundary.  So if the start date is September 2, then the "2014-2015 season" runs from September 2, 2014, to September 1, 2015.

A typical season setup consists of these steps:

0. A season consists of one or more **shows** or productions.  Each show has one or more **show dates** or performances.  Season setup begins with adding shows and then show dates for each show.

0. A **voucher type** represents a particular type of ticket: general admission, discount admission, comp ticket, and so on.  A given voucher type is only valid during a particular season, though you can easily "clone" a voucher type from a previous season in setting up this season.  So the next step in season setup is indicating which voucher types are in use this season.

0.  Finally, a **redemption** specifies which kinds of vouchers can be sold for which performances.  For example, you might offer a "Matinee Discount" voucher that is valid for matinees but not evening shows.  The final step in season setup is associating voucher types with show dates, and optionally, capacity controls (you may want to hold back a certain number of house seats on opening night, or you may want to limit the number of "special discount" tickets that can be sold for any one performance).

## Setting Up Shows and Show Dates

To set up a new season, you need Box Office Manager privilege or higher. 

## Adding Voucher Types

A voucher type represents a particular type of ticket or other product sold during a specific season, and can be in one of several categories:
* **revenue** a normal single ticket for which you charge money
* **comp**, a single-ticket complimentary admission
* **subscriber**, a voucher only available as part of a package, like a subscription that includes one ticket to each of 4 shows
* **bundle**, a collection of  vouchers that can be sold as a single product (like a subscription or two-fer)
* **nonticket** item, which lets you "sell" other products like ticket-exchange fees, concession-stand items, etc.

Each voucher type is valid only for the specific season associated with it, beginning on the season start date you specify in Admin > Options and ending one year later.  Each new season, you need to create a new set of voucher types for that season, even if many of the prices are the same.

## Specifying Redemptions

A voucher type just specifies how much a ticket costs and who is allowed to buy it; it doesn't specify what performances it's valid for, or what the sales period is for that type of ticket for that performance. That information is carried in a **redemption**, which associates a particular voucher type with one or more performances for which that type of voucher can be used, and possibly specifies start/end sales dates, capacity controls, and promo-code-controlled discounts for that voucher type.

Click on the Season tab, click on a show name, and click Add Ticket Type to All Performances.  You can then choose a voucher type that can be redeemed for performances of that show and specify when sales of that voucher type begin and end.

You can also click on "New..." under a particular performance to add a voucher type to just selected performances.

You can also specify capacity controls, so that certain voucher types (e.g. discount tickets) are quantity-limited per performance, and "promo codes" that patrons can type in to reveal vouchers at special prices.

You can also associate specific voucher types with only a particular performance rather than all performances.  To do this, click on the Season tab, then the show name, and next to the desired performance click "Show Ticket Details".  This will reveal all voucher types that can be redeemed for that performance; you can add a new voucher type (click "Add New...") or make changes to the existing ones.  

You cannot delete a voucher type from a performance if some vouchers of that type have already been sold; however, you can prevent further sales of that voucher type by adjusting its "max sales" limit to the number already sold for that performance.
