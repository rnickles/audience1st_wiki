# Front of House Dashboard

When you click the _Front of House_ tab, you'll see the FOH dashboard which shows you:

* The performance date and time for which you're running FOH (click _Change_ to select a different performance)
* The "true capacity" of the house for this performance
* The number of advance tickets sold for this performance
* The number of walkup tickets sold for this performance (sold at the box office the day of the show)
* The number of seats still available (true capacity less advance sales less walkup sales)

Each time you check-in an advance-reservation customer or make a walkup sale, these totals are redisplayed.

From the FOH dashboard you can do four things:

1. Sell walkup tickets (day of show, sold at box office)
2. Check in customers or parties who have advance tickets (will call).  As you sell walkup tickets and check-in customers electronically, Audience1st tells you how many advance customers you're still waiting on, and how many walkup seats are still available to be sold.
3. Generate a printable door list, if you prefer to check customers in manually (this sacrifices the convenience of the automatic counters, but allows you to run FOH in a box office with no Internet access)
4. Generate a report of walkup tickets sold (i.e., close-of-boxoffice report)

# Walkup sales

If you sell tickets at the box office right before showtime, you can use the Walkup Sales capability.
The Walkup Sales functionality can be accessed by any user whose privilege level is ``Walkup Sales'' or higher.

The Walkup Sales user interface assumes that you do not have time to collect identifying information (i.e. names and addresses) for walkup patrons.  All purchases recorded through the Walkup Sales interface are allocated to the **WALKUP CUSTOMER**, a fictitious placeholder customer that cannot be deleted.  Furthermore, walkup transactions are marked to distinguish them from advance-sales transactions, so that settlement reports based on night-of-show sales can be easily generated.

## When NOT to use the Walkup Sales interface

Two common scenarios may arise on a show night in which the Walkup Sales interface is not appropriate:

1. For whatever reason, you specifically _do_ want to tie a walkup purchase to a particular individual.  In this case, you must enter it just as you would a regular reservation transaction, presumably while the angry mob waits their turn in line.  If the customer is already in Audience1st this only takes a couple of clicks, but if it's a new customer, you'll have to enter their information to create their customer record.

2. A Subscriber without an advance reservation wants to use a Subscriber voucher as a walk-up.  (Your policy on whether to allow this and how to handle it may vary.)  In this case, you must visit the Subscriber's account and place the reservation just as you would for an advance reservation.  Walkup Sales user privilege specifically allows this operation, for this exact reason. 

## How to record walkup sales

Click the **Box Office** tab to go the front-of-house display, then the **Walkup Sales** tab.  A two-column screen will appear. At the top of the leftmost column, you can select a performance date (it defaults to today's date).  Beneath that are dropdown menus for _every ticket type allowed for walkup sales for this performance._  (When a ticket type is set up, the box office manager can indicate whether that ticket type is allowed to be sold to walkup patrons or not.) 

To record a walkup purchase, simply select the correct performance date, then select the number(s) of ticket(s) of each type, and optionally add any additional donation.

Then in the rightmost column, you can enter payment:

* To accept a cash payment, take the customer's money and select _Cash or Zero-Revenue_, then click _Record Cash Payment or Zero Revenue Transaction_.  (The latter option allows you to use the walkup screen to issue comps, though we don't advise it because then you have no way to track who used the comp.)

* To accept a check, select _Check_ and optionally enter the check number or other info, then click _Record Check Payment_.

* To accept a credit card if you **do not** have a swipe reader, select _Credit Card_, then enter the credit card information (CVV code in the red field, followed by first and last name, card number, and expiration date), then click _Charge Credit Card_.

* To accept a credit card payment if you **do have** a MagTek 2104-0108 or compatible (3-track reader that emulates an unencrypted USB keyboard), **first** manually enter the CVV code in the red field (since this code number is not present on the magnetic stripe), **then** swipe the credit card through the reader to record the charge.

After every walkup sale, the available-seat count and walkup-sales count are adjusted.

## Recovering from errors

Did you accidentally sell a ticket to the wrong performance?  Click _Whoops, I Made a Mistake_ and you can transfer selected vouchers to another performance.

# Walkup Sales Report 

The walkup sales report shows the total walkup sales broken down by payment method, so you can reconcile the box office cash drawer at close of boxoffice.

# Advance reservations check-in

If you click _Reservation Checkin_, you'll see a list of all customers with advance tickets for this performance, in alphabetical order.  Customers highlighted in green are Subscribers.  To check-in all or part of a party, click on the appropriate number next to that customer's name.  For example, if 3 people out of a party of 4 for Jason Mahoney have arrived, click the number 3 next to Jason Mahoney's name.  

You can "un-check-in" an entire party by clicking the **X** next to the customer's name.
