There are four basic categories of reports:

1. Ticket Sales Reports tell you how many tickets and of what types have been sold for a given production or performance.
2. Accounting/Financial reports categorize your income and expenses by production, by account code (see below), and by payment method (credit card, check, etc.)
3. Customer Lists let you search for customers based on criteria such as which shows they've attended, what their zip code is, whether they've donated recently, and so on.  The results of these queries can be downloaded as Excel spreadsheets (e.g. for printing mailing labels) or can be sent to an Email Marketing Platform such as MailChimp or ConstantContact.
4. Orders Needing Fulfillment generates a list of mailing-label-friendly names and addresses for customers who have placed orders requiring mail fulfillment.  When a voucher or other saleable item is set up, one of the options is "Requires mail fulfillment"; any orders including such products will show up on this list.
5. Subscription Counts tell you how many Subscriptions you've sold this season and of what types.

# Ticket Sales

To see advance sales for one or more productions, under the _Reports_ tab select the production(s) to report on (use control-click on Windows or command-click on Mac to select multiple performances).  When the report is displayed, you can click on individual performances to reveal a detailed breakdown of sales by ticket type.

# Accounting/Financial Reports

Every dollar of earned revenue (i.e. ticket sales) and unearned revenue (i.e. donations) is credited to some Account Code.  You can think of account codes as fund numbers; for example, if you use external software such as QuickBooks to do your accounting, you can create account codes that match the numerical codes QuickBooks typically uses.

Audience1st always comes with one "default" account code for the General Fund.  You can add your own account codes and you can delete the default one, but you can never delete the only account code.  Adding and editing account codes is available from most screens where you must provide an account code in order to do something.

To run a financial report, select the desired transaction dates and the report type, and select which Account Codes you want to include in the report (control-click or command-click to select multiple).

* Transaction Details shows you a record per payment transaction, where every element of the record (order number, customer name, etc.) is clickable to go to the details of that order.

* Earned and Unearned Revenue shows you ticket, retail item, and donation income, subtotaled by payment type, production name, and account code.

When the report results are displayed, at the top of the report output you'll see buttons to allow you to generate an Excel (CSV) spreadsheet or a nicely-formatted PDF file of the report.

# Customer lists: Show me patrons who...

The various types of Customer Lists can be used to filter patrons who meet specific criteria regarding show attendance, activity on your site (i.e. last time they logged in or bought tickets), address info, and more.  Spend some time exploring the different report types.

All the reports have in common a "What do with the results" options.  You can estimate the number of matching customers without generating the list; display the list of matching customers on the screen; download the list of matching customers as an Excel spreadsheet; or, if you have configured Audience1st to communicate with MailChimp or Constant Contact, you can send the resulting list to one of those services so you can use the list for a targeted email campaign.  If you use MailChimp, the list you export will appear as a new "static segment" of your MailChimp master list, with a name that you choose.  Constant Contact support is coming soon.

# Orders Needing Fulfillment

Most theaters fulfill subscriptions by mail, sending out a nice brochure and thank-you letter.  When you create subscription packages and vouchers, you can mark the "Needs mail fulfillment" property on the voucher, and at any time you can use this report to get a list of all the orders that require something to be mailed out to the customer.

As you stuff each envelope, click _Mark Fulfilled_ next to the customer's name.  Audience1st will record the date, time, and who was logged in to fulfill this order, and the order won't show up as needing mail fulfillment anymore.
