# Audience1st: Ticket Sales, Subscriber/Patron Management, Donation Tracking Features and FAQs

Audience1st integrates your own ticket sales, third-party ticket sales
(such as Theatre Bay Area and Goldstar), box office reports,
calendar and ticket availability information (which can be easily
RSS'd into your web site), attendance statistics, donor management
and followup, online donations, and support for email marketing
campaigns, all in one Web-based system. 

Audience1st was developed specifically for the needs of small-to-medium nonprofit
community theaters. 

The table of contents at right will help you navigate this users' guide. This page is a summary of the main features; the other sections step you through using the actual software.

If you're interested in standing up and operating the software yourself, see the README.md in the main code repo.

## Flexible Ticketing

* Payments are handled via integration with
[Stripe](http://stripe.com).  For walk-up and phone orders, you can also
choose to accept cash or checks. 

* Set up multiple ticket types and price points for each
production. Per-performance overrides are possible if you want to offer
special tickets, promotions, etc. for selected performances only. 

* Set up, redeem, and track "promo codes" that reveal special prices.

* Any type of ticket can be capacity-controlled and have start sales/end
sales dates that override the defaults for the production (allowing,
e.g., a "preferred" group of patrons to have early access to ticket
sales, or allowing a time-limited promotional ticket price). 
Holdbacks (such as for group sales, TBA Free Night of Theatre, etc.)
are easy to do on a per-performance basis.  

* All actions are audited so you can tell who entered what transaction,
in case a customer claims a discrepancy. 

* Comps can be added to customer accounts by boxoffice staff. Different
types of comps (professional, performer, media, etc.) can be tracked
separately and capacity-controlled per performance. 

* Sell course enrollments and retail items (swag, raffle tickets, etc.) as well as tickets.

* Patrons can buy or reserve online, or your phone staff can easily
enter phone orders, all with automatic email confirmations whenever reservations are made or cancelled.

* Create and sell virtually any combination of tickets imaginable as a
subscription:  per-show,
restricted to specific performances only (e.g. "Matinee Series"), flex
pass (vouchers valid for any performance), individual series, or one of
everything.  Easily identify subscribers on all reports and give them exclusive or advance access to certain tickets.

* Subscribers can make and cancel their own subscriber reservations online with no
fee (at your discretion) and no box office intervention. 

* Customers can self-purchase online with a credit card or you can have
orders entered by your phone staff on behalf of a customer, with email
confirmations automatically generated.  The phone staff see the same user interface as patrons, so it's easy
for a patron to become a phone staff volunteer.  


* Comments can be added to any reservation by customer or staff, at time
of purchase or after purchase (e.g. special seating needs, guest of
honor, etc.) 

## Front of House


* A separate, one-screen, streamlined user interface for walk-up sales
(at the box office) makes it easy to train volunteers to do limited
box-office-only work selling tickets at showtime, accepting cash,
checks, a manually entered credit card number (when patron presents
card), or a USB-attached [card swipe
device](http://www.amazon.com/MagTek-Mini-Swipe-Readers-21040108/dp/B00466QS5U)
(ditto). 

* Front of house "dashboard" displays the number of seats sold for
tonight's show, number remaining, number held back, and number of
advance purchasers who have checked in.  When a will-call patron
arrives, just check off their name and the totals are updated. 
Close-of-boxoffice report lets you easily reconcile total walkup sales
against box office cash inventory. 


## Back office: Audience Development & Stewardship

* Flexible reporting can be used to select any subset of customers
(e.g., "all customers who saw show X" or "all customers who have made at
least 3 purchases in the past year").  Reports can be exported to
Mailchimp for mail campaigns, or to Excel spreadsheets to create mailing
lists or mailing labels.

* Customers can donate online at time of purchase; donations received by
mail or in person can also be recorded by staff.  Donations are tracked
and tied to customer record along with ticket purchases, giving you a
comprehensive view of patron behavior over time. 

* Track donors, donations, and acknowledgment letters.  Donation
reporting/search allows exporting of selected donors to Excel 
for further analysis or mail-merge. 

* Setup different donation campaigns with their own landing pages and
separate QuickBooks account codes, and run reports on donors based on
almost any donation critera.  You can also track in-kind donations. 

* Define your own customer "tags" (VIP, Prospective Board Member, etc.)
and search for customers by tags.

* Import historical data--mailing lists and customer lists--in Excel
format.  Import will-call lists from popular third-party ticketing
services like Goldstar and Brown Paper Tickets. 

## Integration With Your Own Site and Other Services

* Match your Web site's look and feel using CSS. 

* RSS feeds provide real-time ticket availability info directly to your
website.

* Customers can opt out of email, paper mailings, or both.

# Features Not Supported At This Time

* No reserved seating: currently Audience1st handles only
general-seating venues. This may change in the future. 

* No printing on ticket stock: Audience1st emphasizes an electronic
ticketing/will-call scenario. Coming soon, customers or the box office
will be able to self-print tickets at home. However, there are no plans
to support specialized ticket printing hardware.
