# Looking Up a Customer

If you're logged in as any kind of admin (i.e. Staff or higher privilege), under the main navigation "tabs" is a yellow ribbon whose top line says something like "Customer: Armando Fox" and which contains several search boxes.  This is the customer navigation bar ("customer navbar"), which only admins can see.

There are two ways to search for a customer.  The "Quick search first or last name" will auto-complete possible customer matches as you type, but it will only match substrings in the customer's first or last name.  "Search any field" will find all matching customers by searching their name, address, comments, zip code, phone number, etc.

You can also browse the entire list of customers by clicking "All" in the customer navbar, and click on a customer to select them.

# Manually Adding a New Customer

Click "New..." in the customer navbar to manually enter information for a new customer.  Note that the first time they login they will have to use the "Forgot password" feature to set a password for themselves, and this is only possible if you include a correct email address when entering the new customer info.

# The Current Customer

No matter how you look up a customer, once you select them they become the "Current Customer", and their name now appears next to "Customer" in the customer navbar.

You are now acting on behalf of the current customer: the buttons "Add Comps", "Orders", "Transfer", and so on apply to the current customer's account.  In addition, if you click the nav tabs "Buy Tickets", "My Tickets", "Contact Info", and so on, you will be acting as that customer as if they themselves were logged in.

Most operations you do on a customer's behalf -- buying tickets for them, helping them with a reservation, entering or changing their contact info -- require that you first make that customer the Current Customer.  There are three ways to do this: Browsing the customer list, searching for a specific customer, or creating a new customer record.

* To **browse the whole list**, click the "All" button in the customer navbar.  The first page of customer names will appear in summary form (first and last name, mailing address, email, phone).  Clicking on the first or last name of a customer will make that person the current customer.  (**NOTE:** If you want to generate a list of customers for reporting purposes, use the Reports tab instead.)

* To **search based on first or last name only**, start typing a customer's first or last name into the "Quick Search First or Last Name" box.  As you add letters, a dropdown menu will appear showing all the choices that match the letters you've typed so far; the more letters you type, the more you constrain the choices.  When you see the customer you're searching for appear in the dropdown menu, click their name and then "Go" to make them the current customer.

* To **search based on other fields** such as mailing address (street name), zip code, email, phone number, etc., enter some text into the "Search any field" box and click "Go".  A list of matching records will appear.  Click on a customer's first or last name to make them the current customer.

* To **create a new customer record** (after ensuring the customer in question doesn't already show up in any searches), click the "New..." button in the customer navbar and enter the minimum required information to create the customer record.  When customers self-signup, they are required to provide name, address, phone, and email at a minimum, but when an admin creates a new customer, only a name is required (though you should provide as much information as you have).

## Purchasing tickets for a customer

Make the desired customer the current customer, and click "Buy Tickets" to purchase tickets on behalf of the customer, providing either their credit card info for payment or recording the receipt of cash or a check.  This purchase flow is the same one the customer would see if they self-purchase, except that their only payment option is credit card.

You can also click the "My Tickets" tab to see the current customer's currently held tickets and reservations.

## Viewing or changing customer contact info, privilege level, and labels
 
Click "Billing/Contact" to see or modify the customer's contact information (mailing address, email, etc.)  You can make changes and click Save to update the customer's contact info.

Contact info also includes "opt out of US mail" and "opt out of email".  This setting affects customer report generation, i.e. when you generate a list of customers for a marketing email, customers who have opted out of email will be excluded.  This function is necessary to remain compliant with CAN-SPAM and similar legislation; it cannot be disabled.

A framed set of fields labeled "Administrator Preferences" displays customer information that only admins can see and change, including:

* **Privilege level** lets you turn an existing patron into an admin (perhaps they are volunteering in the box office or back office).  To add new staff members, make sure they exist as a regular customer, then use this screen to escalate their privilege.

* **Labels** lets you create labels of your own choosing to "tag" customers with; for example, "Potential donor", "Advisory board member", "Community leader", etc.  A customer can be associated with as many labels as you want. Click "Create new label names" to create labels.  The Reports feature lets you search for customers having specific labels.

* **Staff comments** lets you enter private comments about this customer that only admins can see.

* **Extra contact info** lets you associate additional contact information with this customer, such as the name of their business, alternate phone number, best way to contact them, and so on.  Customers cannot access this information.

The "Do not email customer a confirmation of these changes" box is checked by default.  If you un-check it, then when you click "Save" to save changes to this customer, a summary email will be sent to them (if they have a valid email address) indicating the changes.  (Changes to admin-only-visible fields, such as Staff Comments or customer privilege level, will not be indicated in this confirmation email.)

# Merging duplicate customers

Some customers will inadvertently create multiple accounts for themselves, and become confused when they login to account #2 and don't see the tickets they purchased under account #1.  In this case, the best thing to do is merge the accounts.

To merge accounts, both customer names must be visible in the summary listing.  For example, if you suspect customer Al Johns has duplicate entries, use the Search Any Field box in the customer navbar to search for "Al Johns", and you'll see a summary list of all records matching that search.  Presumably, two of the matching records will be the two duplicate entries for Al Johns, possibly shown alongside Albert Jones, Alice Johnson, and so on.

To merge two customer accounts shown in the summary list:

0. Click the checkbox to the left of each customer's name.  (You can only merge two customers at a time.  If there are more than two duplicate records for a customer, repeat this process for each pair.)

0. If you click "Manual Merge", you'll be shown the two customers' contact info side-by-side in two columns; you decide which information to use in the merged record.

0. If you click "Auto Merge", Audience1st will make these choices automatically by preferring the information belonging to the account that was accessed most recently.

All purchases, donations, and other activity from both accounts will be preserved in the merged account.

Audience1st doesn't allow creating two accounts with the same email, so after a merge, the customer will only be able to login using the email and password that were retained during the merge.  (Whichever email address you choose to retain in manual merge, the corresponding password is retained too.)  You may  need to communicate with the customer to remind them that only this single email address can now be used to login, although once they login they can always change their email or password to something else, as long as the email address is unique in the database.

## Grooming the database for duplicates

If you click the "Dups" button in the customer navbar, you'll see a list of records that Audience1st suspects might be duplicates, based on some simple rules about similarity.  It's a good idea to "groom" the database periodically by clicking the Dups button and merging duplicate accounts.

# Deleting customers

To delete a customer, get their name into the summary list view, click the checkbox to the left, and click "Forget".  This does two things, neither of which can be undone, so use this feature carefully:

* The customer's name and contact info are permanently removed from the database.

* Any purchases, donations, etc. made by the customer are transferred to the "Anonymous Customer", a special fictional customer named "ANONYMOUS", so that the books still balance.  If Alice Johnson donated $1,000 and then you "Forget" her account, the $1,000 donation will now be "credited" to the anonymous customer instead.  **This cannot be undone.**  In the future there will be a way to make a customer "inactive" (so they don't show up in searches and reports) without using Forget.
