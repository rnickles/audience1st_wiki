# Voucher Types

A voucher type represents a particular type of ticket or other product sold during a specific season, and can be in one of several categories:
* **revenue** a normal single ticket for which you charge money
* **comp**, a single-ticket complimentary admission
* **subscriber**, a voucher only available as part of a package, like a subscription that includes one ticket to each of 4 shows
* **bundle**, a collection of  vouchers that can be sold as a single product (like a subscription or two-fer)
* **nonticket** item, which lets you "sell" other products like ticket-exchange fees, concession-stand items, etc.

Each voucher type is valid only for the specific season associated with it, beginning on the season start date you specify in Admin > Options and ending one year later.  Each new season, you need to create a new set of voucher types for that season, even if many of the prices are the same.

# Redemptions

A voucher type just specifies how much a ticket costs and who is allowed to buy it; it doesn't specify what performances it's valid for, or what the sales period is for that type of ticket for that performance. That information is carried in a **redemption**, which associates a particular voucher type with one or more performances for which that type of voucher can be used, and possibly specifies start/end sales dates, capacity controls, and promo-code-controlled discounts for that voucher type.

To specify this information, click on the Season tab, click on a show name, and click Add Ticket Type to All Performances.  You can then choose a voucher type that can be redeemed for performances of that show and specify when sales of that voucher type begin and end.

You can also specify capacity controls, so that certain voucher types (e.g. discount tickets) are quantity-limited per performance, and "promo codes" that patrons can type in to reveal vouchers at special prices.

You can also associate specific voucher types with only a particular performance rather than all performances.  To do this, click on the Season tab, then the show name, and next to the desired performance click "Show Ticket Details".  This will reveal all voucher types that can be redeemed for that performance; you can add a new voucher type (click "Add New...") or make changes to the existing ones.  

You cannot delete a voucher type from a performance if some vouchers of that type have already been sold; however, you can prevent further sales of that voucher type by adjusting its "max sales" limit to the number already sold for that performance.
