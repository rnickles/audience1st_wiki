# Privilege model

Each user of the system has one of six privilege levels.  A user of a higher level can do everything that a user of lower levels can do.  The levels in order of increasing privilege are:

Patron Staff
Walkup Sales
Box Office Associate
Box Office Manager
Administrator
0. Patron: The default level: can log into her own account, manage her own reserva- tions, and edit her own contact information.

0. Staff: Can also generate reports, including mailing lists, box office statistics, etc. Can record donations, search and update patron contact information, and so on. This is the appropriate category for any staff member who needs reporting capabilities but does not deal directly with reservation processing.

0. Walkup Sales: can also do day-of-show box office procedures, such as generating the will-call list, processing walkup sales transactions, and generating the box office settlement report.

0. Box Office: Can also make and cancel advance reservations, search the patron database, update patron information, add and remove comp vouchers from patron accounts, refund orders.

0. Box Office Manager: Can also do season setup: add/edit shows, add/edit performance dates, add/edit voucher types and bundle types, determine which voucher types can be redeemed for which performances.

0. Admin: Can grant/revoke any of the above privileges to other users.

In this guide, "admin" refers loosely to any non-patron privilege level.

# Act on behalf of

All privilege levels Staff or higher can act on behalf of a patron. That is, they can search for a patron by name, view that account as if they were the patron, and generally do all the things the patron could do, acting on behalf of the patron.  

The user interface seen by staff and patrons is the same, except staff see some additional controls and tabs that patrons do not see.    At the bottom of every page is a button "Regular Patron View" that lets the logged-in admin see that page as a regular patron would see it (if the page is accessible to patrons at all).

# Admins can override everything

Various features of Audience1st are designed to limit what patrons can do: how far in advance of a show they can reserve tickets, whether they can cancel their own reservations, and enforcement of capacity controls on both overall house size and ticket type inventories.

Admins of any level are immune to these restrictions.  They can oversell the house, redeem tickets not normally acceptable for a given performance, and so on, and usually are given a warning when they are doing so.
