The following information should help you get this Rails 2/Ruby 1.8.7 app deployed.

# Legacy Ruby/Rails

The app is on Rails 2.3.18 (2.3.5 with security patches) and Ruby 1.8.7.  I've been meaning to migrate it to Rails 3 and then Rails 4.  Help welcome.

But for now you'll have to get Rails 2.3.18 and Ruby 1.8.7 deployed on whatever host you want to deploy to.  I've been using Rackspace with Apache, mod_rails, and Phusion Passenger.

This is a stock Rails app, with the following exceptions/additions:

0. The task `Customer.notify_upcoming_birthdays` emails an administrator or boxoffice manager with information about customers whose birthdays are coming up soon.  The threshold for "soon" can be set in Admin > Options.

0. The task `EmailGoldstar.receive(STDIN.read)` should be invoked to consume incoming emails from Goldstar.  See the installation section on Goldstar integration, below.

# Required external integrations

You will need to create a file `config/application.yml` containing the following:

```yaml
session_secret: "30 or more random characters string"
stripe_key: "stripe public (publishable) key"
stripe_secret: "stripe private API key"
# include at most one of the following two lines - not both:
email_integration: "MailChimp"  # if you use MailChimp, include this line verbatim, else omit
email_integration: "ConstantContact" # if you use CC, include this line verbatime, else omit
# if you included one of the two Email Integration choices:
mailchimp_key: "optional: if you use Mailchimp, API key; otherwise omit this entry"
constant_contact_username: "Username for CC login, if using CC"
constant_contact_password: "password for CC login, if using CC"
constant_contact_key: "CC publishable part of API key"
constant_contact_secret: "CC secret part of API key"
```
