# External Integrations

The following mechanisms may help you integrate Audience1st with your theater's content site.  All URLs below are relative to the base URL of your deployment.

## Links for donations

URL `/donate` takes the patron to a "quick donate" page where they can make a credit card donation without logging in or having an account. Donations go to the default donation fund specified at setup time.

URL `/donate_to_fund/`_nnnn_ takes the patron to a page coded to donate to the fund whose account code number is nnnn, for specific fundraising campaigns.  For example, if you have a fund coded 83956 for a particular project, `/donate_to_fund/83956` will go to a page that accepts donations to that fund.

## Links for purchasing tickets, camps, subscriptions

* `/store` goes to the purchase page for regular show tickets.

* `/store?what=Class` goes to the purchase page for classes and camps.

* `/store?what=Special+Event` goes to the purchase page for special events.  (Patrons can easily switch among the regular tickets, classes, and special events pages, so these mechanisms are for convenience.)

* `/store?show_id=nnnn` goes to a purchase page prepopulated for the production (show) whose ID is `nnnn`.  In the Season Setup view, there are buttons to generate the link text for any of the productions.  Note that a class/camp or special event is also a production, so you can also use this mechanism to send the patron to a purchase page for a particular class/camp or special event.

* `/store?showdate_id=nnnn` goes to a purchase page prepopulated for a specific performance of a production, where the performance's ID is `nnnn`.  In the Season Setup view, click on a show's name to display the list of performance dates; next to each date is a button to generate the link text for that performance.  For classes/camps, you can use this to send the patron to a purchase page prepopulated for a particular session ("performance date") of a class/camp.

* `/subscribe` goes to the main subscription purchase page.

## RSS feeds

Audience1st has RSS feeds of real-time ticket information.  Many Web authoring tools such as WordPress and Drupal have RSS plug-ins.

* `/info/ticket_rss` returns an RSS feed of the next 3 months' worth of shows, classes and special events.

* `/info/ticket_rss?what=`_list_ returns an RSS feed of only the next 3 months' worth of things in _list_, which should be a hyphen-separated list of one or more of the following: `Show`, `Class`, `Special+Event`.  For example `/info/ticket_rss?what=Class-Special+Event` returns the classes and special events in the next 3 months, but not the regular shows.  The returned items look like this:

```
    <item>
      <title>A - Camp Three 2015 - Monday, Jul 27, 9:00 AM (First Day of Camp) - SOLD OUT</title>
      <guid permalink="false">http://www.audience1st.com/ccct/store?showdate_id=424&amp;amp;ts=1433811199&amp;amp;what=Special+Events</guid>
    </item>
```
