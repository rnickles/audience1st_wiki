* Can Audience1st send large amounts of email (for example, to advertise a show to our customers)?
  * No, though it does integrate with MailChimp (an email-list-blast service) and (soon) could easily integrate with ConstantContact (similar service).  The reason for this deliberate choice is that sending "blast" emails does not work: spam filters are very, very aggressive, CAN-SPAM laws are strict, and the only chance for an email to get through to lots of people is if it is sent by a reputable and well managed email list service.  MailChimp and ConstantContact are probably the two most popular, though others exist. 
* What happens to the revenue from ticket purchases?
  * Audience1st gets connected to a [Stripe](http://stripe.com) payment processing account that your theater sets up for credit card processing.  Stripe accounts are free to set up and have zero monthly fees.  You can then setup your Stripe account to transfer money directly into your theater's regular bank account.
