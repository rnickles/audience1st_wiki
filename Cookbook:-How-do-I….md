How do I designate a particular performance as a private event (house sale, closed performance, etc.) so that Web customers can't buy tickets to it?

> You can either make sure there are NO ticket types valid for that performance, in which case "No tickets on sale for this performance" appears if that date is selected, or you can delete that performance entirely from the Edit Show view, and its performance date won't even appear in dropdown menus. 

How do I generate a list of patrons matching specific criteria?

> Login as an administrative user (staff level or higher) and click on the Reports tab.  Near the middle of the page, look for Customer Lists, and select the type of report you want to run.  Each report has different criteria you can fill in.  All reports have a common set of Output Options that describe additional filtering you can do.

Can I export lists of patrons directly to my email marketing provider (EMP) like Mailchimp™ or ConstantContact™?

> Yes.  When you generate any report, under Output Options you will see buttons for "Add to Sublist", where you can add the results of this report to an existing sublist or put them in their own new sublist.  You can then see this sublist when you log in to your EMP.  (For example, with Mailchimp the sublists appear as "static list segments" of your Master List, so you can send a campaign only to specific segments).

How do I create hyperlinks that take the customer to the ticket purchase page with a particular show or performance pre-selected? 

> Log in as an admin and click on the Season tab; you'll see a list of shows.  Next to each show name is a "Link" button; clicking it will display a link that opens the store page with the first performance of this show pre-selected.  If you want to pre-select a specific showdate, instead click on the name of the show and you'll see a list of show dates.  Next to each date is a "Link" button that will display a link that will pre-select that performance on the store page.

If I have an invalid, bad or undeliverable US mailing address for a customer, how do I prevent it from appearing in mailing lists?

> Locate the customer's record and click Contact Info tab.  You can either blank out the address fields or check the box for "Don't send me materials by US Mail".  Either action will prevent the customer from appearing in mailing lists as long as the "Require valid US Mail address" is checked when generating the list.
