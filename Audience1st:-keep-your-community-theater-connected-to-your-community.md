**Patron relationships shouldn't end when they buy a ticket.**  Most low-cost third-party ticketing systems give you no easy way to track customers across purchases, keep track of customers' buying histories, distinguish Subscribers from VIPs from one-time ticket buyers from repeat single-ticket buyers (for targeting upsells), target repeat buyers for donation campaigns or special recognition, or target email campaigns at patrons with specific buying patterns. Many ticketing systems don't even extend their ticket sales to front-of-house walk-up sales, so you have to do extra work and manual reconciliation for tickets sold at the door and tickets sold in advance.

Audience1st integrates ticket sales, front-of-house, and development in a single zero-installation suite.

# A1 Box Office: Subscriptions, Tickets and More

Besides single-ticket sales, virtually any kind of subscription package you can think of can be setup for online purchase.  Subscribers can manage their own reservations and cancellations online.  And since subscribers are the backbone of your ticket sales for the season, they are specifically distinguished in Audience1st so you can easily offer tickets or products available only to them, or generate reports or mailing lists targeted at existing or prospective subscribers.

Integrations with your own website allow patrons to immediately see availability information for each show and to follow links pre-populated for a particular performance or production. Audience1st can be tailored to match the look and feel of your venue’s existing Website via CSS.

* Set up multiple ticket types and price points for each production.  Set up, redeem, and track “promo codes” that reveal special prices, whether for selected performances only or for all performances. 
*  If you use external vendors such as Goldstar or Tix Bay Area, those will-call lists can be automatically integrated with your regular lists.  Existing customers are detected automatically so you can track customers who have purchased tickets for your shows from mutiple sources.  Unsold tickets allocated to third-party vendors are automatically released back into general inventory.
* Any type of ticket can be capacity-controlled and have start sales/end sales dates that override the defaults for the production (allowing, e.g., a “preferred” group of patrons to have early access to ticket sales, or allowing a time-limited promotional ticket price).
*  Holdbacks (such as for group sales, TBA Free Night of Theatre, etc.) are easy to do on a per-performance basis.
*   All actions are audited so you can tell who entered what transaction, in case a customer claims a discrepancy.
*  Comps can be added to customer accounts by boxoffice staff. Different types of comps (professional, performer, media, etc.) can be tracked separately and capacity-controlled per performance. “E-comp” codes can also be given to customers who can then redeem their comps online later.
*  The user interface for telephone sales by staff is basically the same as for self-purchase, so no special training needed to fulfill phone orders.
* Comments can be added to any reservation by customer or staff, at time of purchase or after purchase (e.g. special seating needs, guest of honor, different person will pickup tickets, etc.)
*  "Nonticket products" feature allows you to sell additional products (preferred seating upgrade, free glass of wine, ticket exchange fee, etc.) with separate accounting codes, either by boxoffice only or for customer self-purchase.
* Customers can donate online at time of purchase; donations received by mail or in person can also be recorded by staff.  Donations are tracked and tied to customer record along with ticket purchases, giving you a comprehensive view of patron behavior over time.
*  Virtually any kind of subscription is possible, including per-show, restricted to specific performances only (e.g. “Matinee Series”), flex pass (vouchers valid for any performance), individual series, or one of everything.
* Subscribers are visually distinguished in sales reports, will-call lists, etc. so you can single them out for special treatment if you wish.
* Subscribers can make and cancel their own reservations online with no fee (at your discretion) and no box office intervention.
* You can create tickets for special events that are either available to subscribers only, or discounted for subscribers; for example, subscriber-only VIP access to a special event, subscribers getting earlier access to certain tickets than nonsubscirbers, or “guest of subscriber” discount tickets for subscribers to bring friends to the show.
*  Collect revenue for other products, such as tuition for courses, galas, or other special events. Each product offered for sale can be distinguished as to whether it requires separate fulfillment, e.g. mailing an item to the customer, vs. “will-call” fulfillment only. Reports can be run to indicate which orders still have fulfillment outstanding.

# A1 Front-of-House:  That Crazy Time Right Before Curtain

A streamlined front-of-house (day of show) user interface supports quick walk-up sales, last-minute cancellations/no-shows/date changes, subscribers who show up unannounced and want to be accommodated, and other box office scenarios—we’ve seen them all.

* Front of house "dashboard" displays the number of seats sold for tonight's show, number remaining, number held back, and number of advance purchasers who have checked in.  When a will-call patron arrives, just check off their name and the totals are updated.
* Walk-up sales can be cash, check, or credit card.  If you have an Internet connection at the box office, you don't need any separate equipment to do fast credit card purchases.  With one-time purchase of a MagTek™ credit card swipe, you can process them even faster by not having to type information off the credit card manually.   (Requires a computer with available USB port.)  Every walkup sale updates the "capacity remaining" dashboard.
* No Internet service at the walk-up box office? You can enter the walkup sales as a batch transaction after the box office closes.  Either way, walk-up sales are integrated seamlessly with your advance sales and third-party vendor sales (Goldstar, etc.)
* Close-of-boxoffice report lets you easily reconcile total walkup sales against box office cash inventory.

# Audience Development

**No more "spreadsheets from hell."**   When you're not selling tickets to a current production, you're planning the next season and how you're going to grow your subscriber base and upsell your discount-ticket patrons. That's when you really need access to your customer data--for marketing, audience development, donor outreach and subscription upselling, so box office managers and marketing specialists can spend their time and effort focusing on creative campaign execution, rather than manually shuffling a collection of "spreadsheets from hell".

* Generate lists of customers based on almost any criterion: performances seen (or not seen), type of ticket used, quantity or amount of recent donations, patrons who subscribed in previous year(s) but haven’t renewed recently, etc.
* Export lists to Excel for printing mailing labels or doing mail-merge, or for email campaigns.  
✓▪▪Export lists directly to MailChimp™ (integration with ConstantContact™ available Spring 2011), so with a single click, you can target a specific subset of your patrons for a promotional email and export just that list to to your email service provider.
* Create your own "labels" to refer to special categories of customers (VIPs, Press, Potential Volunteer, etc.) and generate reports based on the labels.
* Separate tracking of email opt-out vs. US Mail opt-out, so you can generate separate lists.  If you use an external email list management service like MailChimp or ConstantContact, new opt-ins and opt-outs are automatically propagated in both directions.
* Donor management lets you connect donations and ticket purchases, setup different donation campaigns with their own landing pages and separate QuickBooks account codes, and run reports on donors based on almost any donation critera.  You can also track in-kind donations.
* Automatic tracking of which donors you still need to send letters to.  When you send a letter, one click on the donor's name records the time, date and who sent the letter.  Anyone can run a report on which thank-you letters are outstanding.
* Prospects for more aggressive giving can be linked to additional contact information (employer, relationship to theater, etc.) and to individual visit reports, to track relationships with individual patrons over time and send emails to staff reminding them of upcoming follow-up contacts with prospects.

# Run-it-Yourself or Hosted Option Available

You'll open your own Stripe account for credit card processing (5 minute process) and your own Mailgun account for transactional emails (such as individual reservation confirmation emails and e-receipts, as distinct from marketing emails which are mass communications to large groups of patrons).

If you don't want to manage Audience1st yourself, we'll run it for you in a Tier 1 datacenter with daily secure offsite backups of all your databases.
