# External Integrations

The following mechanisms may help you integrate Audience1st with your theater's content site.  All URLs below are relative to the base URL of your deployment.

## Links for donations

URL `/donate` takes the patron to a "quick donate" page where they can make a credit card donation without logging in or having an account. Donations go to the default donation fund specified at setup time.

URL `/donate_to_fund/`_nnnn_ takes the patron to a page coded to donate to the fund whose account code number is nnnn, for specific fundraising campaigns.  For example, if you have a fund coded 83956 for a particular project, `/donate_to_fund/83956` will go to a page that accepts donations to that fund.

## Links for purchasing tickets, camps, subscriptions

* `/store` goes to the purchase page for regular show tickets.

* `/store?what=Class` goes to the purchase page for classes and camps.

* `/store?what=Special+Event` goes to the purchase page for special events.  (Patrons can easily switch among the regular tickets, classes, and special events pages, so these mechanisms are for convenience.)

* `/store?show_id=nnnn` goes to a purchase page prepopulated for the production (show) whose ID is `nnnn`.  In the Season Setup view, there are buttons to generate the link text for any of the productions.  Note that a class/camp or special event is also a production, so you can also use this mechanism to send the patron to a purchase page for a particular class/camp or special event.

* `/store?showdate_id=nnnn` goes to a purchase page prepopulated for a specific performance of a production, where the performance's ID is `nnnn`.  In the Season Setup view, click on a show's name to display the list of performance dates; next to each date is a button to generate the link text for that performance.  For classes/camps, you can use this to send the patron to a purchase page prepopulated for a particular session ("performance date") of a class/camp.

* `/subscribe` goes to the main subscription purchase page.

## RSS feeds

* `/info/ticket_rss` returns an RSS feed of the next 3 months' worth of shows, classes and special events.

* `/info/ticket_rss?what=`_list_ returns an RSS feed of
