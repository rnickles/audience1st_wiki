# Running tests locally

There is a set of Cucumber+Capybara scenarios that test all major user-facing flows and most boxoffice-facing flows, and additional specs to fill gaps.  The current configuration uses [CodeClimate Test Reporter](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/configuring-test-coverage) (CCTR) as part of the CI workflow which runs using GitHub Actions, and reports combined Cucumber + RSpec coverage to CodeClimate to serve the coverage badge.

## Test database

The versioned file `config/database.yml.test` specifies a SQLite3 database for testing.
Once you have created a proper `config/application.yml` as described on the main page, you should be able to successfully
run all scenarios and all specs.  A local run takes 12-15 minutes to run all tests.

Do not version `config/application.yml` but instead use `gpg` or `pgp` to symmetrically encrypt it to `config/application.yml.asc`, and version the encrypted file.  You will use the encryption key below in the CI setup.

## Time

Many features depend on the current time (to test things like reservation
cutoffs, etc.)  **All Cucumber scenarios fix the current date and time
as Jan 1, 2010, 00:00:00 in the application timezone** in
`features/support/env.rb`.  To suppress this for certain scenarios, tag
them with `@time`.

## Stubbing credit card payments

Most scenarios that test payments do stubbing (in `env.rb`) at the level
of the `Store` methods that wrap calls to Stripe.  A few scenarios use
the `FakeStripe` gem.

# GitHub Actions setup

The GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), which normally runs on push, does the following: install libxslt (needed for XML parsing by various gems); install Ruby; create `database.yml` by using the contents of `database.yml.test`; **decrypt the file `config/application.yml.asc` using the decryption key `GPG_SYMMETRIC_KEY`;** run all features & specs while capturing test coverage; report test coverage to CodeClimate **using the `CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID` key.**

The things in bold are GitHub Secrets you have to set up in the repo's Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Repository secrets.

The value of `GPG_SYMMETRIC_KEY` should be the keyphrase you used to symmetrically encrypt your `application.yml` into `application.yml.asc`.

The value of `CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID` should be the key assigned to you when you setup CodeClimate and link your development repo to it for test reporting.  The CodeClimate website has a section explaining how to generate this key.  (Note: CodeClimate now has two products, "CodeClimate Quality" and "CodeClimate Velocity".  Test coverage info is collected in Quality, so create an account there---it should be free for open source projects---and link your development repo to that account.)
